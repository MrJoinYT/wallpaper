This is my first HTML Wallpaper, which can change due to the sunrise or sunset. You can connect it to your own Smart Home or other applications trough some javascript.


To use this, you need to adjust your own lang and long in the weather.js:

assets/weather.js -> Line 21, 22 

To get your latitude and longitude, go to Google maps and click where you want to get the data from.
Then copy the two numbers from the popup which comes up from the bottom.
